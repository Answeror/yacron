# Yet Another Cron

This is a python based cron, with a tray icon. You can write any python scripts and place them in `~/.yacron`. Use [crython](https://github.com/ahawker/crython) to schedule your tasks(functions) defined in these scripts.

An auto checkin task of [xiami.com](http://xiami.com) is already included. You need to change email and password to yours.

## Downloads

* [0.1.1](http://file.answeror.com/yacron-0.1.1-win32.msi)

## Platform

* Python 3.3.2

I've only tested it on win8 x64, but it should also runnable on linux and macos.
